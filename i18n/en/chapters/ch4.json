For the gate is wide and the way is easy that leads to destruction, and those who enter by it are many. For the gate is narrow and the way is hard that leads to life, and those who find it are few.\"</em>"

          "text": "There are two possible directions for the human heart. One curves inward, toward the self—toward my desires, my comfort, my power, my glory. The other opens outward, toward love—toward serving something greater than myself, toward caring for others as I care for myself. One accumulates for itself; the other gives. One seeks to be served; the other seeks to serve. One asks \"what do I gain?\"; the other asks \"how can I love?\""

          "text": "We might call these two orientations {term:polarity}—not as moral judgment but as description of how energy flows. Consider a magnet. It has two poles, positive and negative. Neither pole is superior to the other. Both are necessary for the magnet to function. Yet they operate in fundamentally different ways—one radiates outward, one draws inward. So it is with consciousness."

          "type": "paragraph",
          "text": "The path that radiates outward is the path of service to others. It perceives all beings as expressions of the same Source, as other-selves rather than as competitors or resources. From this perception flows a natural desire to serve, to share, to give. It recognizes that what I do to another, I do to myself, because at the deepest level there is no separation."

          "type": "paragraph",
          "text": "The path that draws inward is the path of service to self. It perceives the universe as a hierarchy of power, where others exist to be used, controlled, or dominated for one's own benefit. This is not stupidity—it is a consistent philosophy applied with great discipline. But it is built upon a fundamental denial: the denial of the heart's natural recognition that we are all one."

          "text": "Jesus illustrated this with an unforgettable parable: the rich man who accumulated so many goods that he had to build bigger barns to store them. <em>\"Soul, you have ample goods laid up for many years; relax, eat, drink, be merry,\"</em> he said to himself. But God said to him: <em>\"Fool! This night your soul is required of you.\"</em> He had lived curved toward himself, and in the end had nothing he could take with him."

What mattered was the direction of her heart. She lived open toward love, trusting even when she had almost nothing."

          "text": "This fundamental choice—inward or outward, for self or for others—presents itself every day in a thousand small forms. In how you respond when someone offends you. In what you do with your free time. In how you treat someone who cannot return the favor. In the thoughts you allow when no one is watching. Each small choice is a vote for one direction or the other. Each moment is an opportunity to strengthen your orientation."

Let each of you look not only to his own interests, but also to the interests of others.\"</em> And then he adds: <em>\"Have this mind among yourselves, which is yours in Christ Jesus.\"</em> The mind of Christ is a mind turned toward others."

          "text": "Jesus himself modeled this perfectly: <em>\"The Son of Man came not to be served but to serve, and to give his life as a ransom for many.\"</em> The Creator of the universe took the form of a servant. He who had every right to demand worship washed the feet of his disciples. He who could have called legions of angels allowed himself to be crucified for the sake of those who crucified him."

          "text": "The path of service to others does not mean being passive or permitting harm. It does not mean abandoning discernment or ignoring your own needs. Jesus drove the money changers from the temple. He spoke fierce truth to hypocrites. He withdrew to rest when he needed to. The path of love includes caring for yourself—you cannot pour from an empty cup. The key lies in proportion and intention. When the welfare of others genuinely matters as much as your own welfare, the positive orientation has taken hold."

          "type": "paragraph",
          "text": "A fundamental characteristic of this path is respect for the freedom of others. The one who serves does not impose help upon those who have not asked. It recognizes that each being must make its own choices, learn its own lessons, walk its own path. This respect sometimes appears as restraint when you yearn to help—but it is not indifference. It is the deepest form of love: the love that honors the other's right to choose."

He offered living water but did not force anyone to drink. He respected our freedom even when our choices broke his heart."

Jesus taught the opposite: <em>\"Whoever would save his life will lose it, but whoever loses his life for my sake will find it.\"</em> We find life by giving it away. We receive by sharing. We are lifted up by bowing down."

We are supported by a love greater than our own, guided by wisdom beyond our understanding, strengthened by a power that works in us <em>\"both to will and to work for his good pleasure.\"</em> We do not depend solely on our own willpower. We depend on grace—the love that meets us where we are and gently draws us toward where we can be."
