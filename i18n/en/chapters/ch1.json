          "text": "Before time existed, before there was light or darkness, space or form, something was. It was not emptiness. It was not nothing. It was absolute fullness, infinite consciousness, love without an object yet complete in itself."

          "type": "paragraph",
          "text": "We can call this original fullness by many names: the Infinite, the Source, the Mystery. The ancient Hebrews avoided pronouncing its name. Mystics of all traditions have pointed toward it with words that always fall short. Because what existed before everything cannot be contained in words. It can only be experienced, intuited, touched in the deepest silence of the heart."

          "text": "The Infinite, being pure love, wanted to know itself. Not from lack, but from abundance. Not from loneliness, but from the desire to share. Love, by its very nature, seeks to give itself. And so, from perfect stillness arose the first movement: the decision to create."

          "text": "In these words from Genesis there is something astonishing: God creates by speaking. He does not fabricate, does not build with hands. He speaks, and it is. The word—conscious intention, directed love—has creative power. The entire universe was born from a word, from a loving thought that wanted to express itself."

        {
          "type": "paragraph",
          "text": "This creation was not like a craftsman making something separate from himself. It was more like the sun emitting light: the light is not something different from the sun, it is the sun extending itself. Thus, everything that exists is the Infinite extending itself, exploring itself, knowing itself through infinite forms and experiences."

          "type": "paragraph",
          "text": "You are one of those forms. Not a creation separate from the Creator, but the Creator itself experiencing from your unique perspective. The Judeo-Christian tradition intuited this when it said we were made <em>\"in the image and likeness\"</em> of God. It did not refer to physical form. It referred to essence: we are consciousness capable of loving, creating, and choosing. We are small mirrors of the Infinite."

          "type": "paragraph",
          "text": "The entire universe, with its galaxies and atoms, with its stars and creatures, is a vast exploration of love knowing itself. Every stone, every plant, every animal, every human being is the Infinite playing at being finite, the eternal testing what it feels like to be temporal, unity experiencing apparent separation."

          "type": "paragraph",
          "text": "Why apparent? Because separation is a necessary illusion for the game. If you always knew you were one with everything, there would be no adventure, no discovery, no joy in finding the way back home. The temporary forgetting of our true nature is not an error or a punishment. It is the stage that makes possible the most extraordinary drama: {term:awakening}."

          "text": "Jesus of Nazareth was not simply a good teacher or just another prophet among many. He was an extraordinarily pure expression of the original love that creates all things. He came from a level of consciousness where love is no longer a difficult choice but the only reality, where the ego has dissolved into service, where the connection with the Source is as clear as mountain water."

        {
          "type": "paragraph",
          "text": "Why did he come? For the same reason the Infinite created: because of love that needs to give itself. He saw humanity trapped in cycles of suffering, forgetful of its true nature, and his heart moved. He came not to judge or condemn, but to remind us who we really are."

He healed the sick with his hands. The same energy that sustains the universe took human form to show us, from within our own experience, the way back home."

          "text": "This does not mean Jesus was the only channel of divine love. The Infinite has many messengers, many traditions, many paths. But for those of us who resonate with his teaching, he represents something precious: the living demonstration that it is possible, here, in a human body, amid life's difficulties, to live from pure love."

It is the expression of a loving intelligence that is knowing itself, and you are an integral part of that knowing. Your joys and sorrows, your triumphs and failures, all form part of a sacred exploration."

          "type": "paragraph",
          "text": "Second, that your deepest nature is not fear, nor lack, nor separation. These are temporary experiences, useful for learning, but they are not your identity. Your identity is love, because you come from love and to love you will return. Everything else is costume, the role you play in this cosmic theater."

        {
          "type": "paragraph",
          "text": "Third, that the path of {term:healing}—yours and others'—begins by recognizing this truth. You do not need to earn God's love. You already have it. You do not need to deserve your place in the universe. You are already an essential part of it. You do not need to be perfect to be loved. The love that created you knows you completely and accepts you as you are, while gently inviting you to awaken to who you can truly be."

        {
          "type": "paragraph",
          "text": "Jesus expressed it simply when asked which commandment was the most important: <em>\"Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind... and thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself.\"</em> In these words is the entire path: reconnect with the Source, and from that connection, let love flow toward all beings."
