          "text": "When Jesus was asked which commandment was the most important, his answer was direct: <em>\"Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind. This is the first and great commandment. And the second is like unto it: Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself. On these two commandments hang all the law and the prophets.\"</em>"

          "text": "In these words, Jesus summarized the entire purpose of human life. He did not complicate things with long lists of rules. He did not create an impossible system to follow. He simply said: love. Love the Source completely. Love others as you love yourself. Everything else flows from there."

          "text": "But Jesus did not only teach love with words—he lived it with every action. He touched the lepers no one wanted to touch. He spoke with the Samaritan woman whom society despised. He forgave the adulteress the crowd wanted to stone. He ate with sinners the religious avoided. He washed his disciples' feet like a servant. And finally, he gave his life for those who rejected him."

          "text": "What made Jesus such an extraordinary healer? It was not technique, not method, not secret knowledge passed down through mystery schools—though he studied in many places during his years of preparation. What made him powerful was something simpler and more profound: he had become a pure {term:channel} for the love that creates all things."

          "text": "A channel, in this sense, is one who allows energy to flow through without obstruction. Most of us are blocked in various ways. Our fears constrict us. Our resentments create knots in our energy. Our self-doubt dims our light. Jesus had done the inner work to clear these obstructions. He had harmonized his mind, his body, and his spirit into a unified instrument through which divine love could pour unimpeded."

          "text": "This is what true {term:healing} actually is: not the manipulation of physical matter, not the forcing of cells to behave differently, but the creation of an environment in which another being can recognize their own capacity for wholeness. The healer does not heal. The healer radiates such love, such light, such presence, that the one who suffers suddenly glimpses who they really are—and in that glimpse, {term:healing} becomes possible."

          "type": "paragraph",
          "text": "Think of it this way: when you enter a room where someone is deeply peaceful, you feel it. Their peace creates a space that invites your own peace to emerge. When you are in the presence of someone who truly loves you without judgment, something in you relaxes, opens, breathes. The healer's presence creates this kind of environment—but amplified, intensified, clarified to such a degree that transformation becomes possible."

          "text": "Jesus understood this. <em>\"It is not I who does the work,\"</em> he said, <em>\"but the Father who dwells in me.\"</em> He did not claim personal power. He claimed connection. He was a doorway through which infinite love could reach finite beings. And those beings, touched by that love, remembered—even if just for a moment—that they too were made of love, that their bodies were meant for wholeness, that their suffering was not their final truth."

          "text": "This is why faith mattered so much in Jesus' healings. <em>\"Thy faith hath made thee whole,\"</em> he told those he healed. It was not that he was withholding power from those without faith. It was that {term:healing} requires the participation of the one being healed. The healer offers an opportunity, an invitation, an environment. But the one who suffers must, at some level, accept the invitation. They must be willing to release their identification with sickness, their attachment to suffering, their belief that they are broken beyond repair."

          "type": "paragraph",
          "text": "Sometimes this acceptance is conscious. The person knows they want to be healed and opens fully to receive. Sometimes it is unconscious—a deep part of the self that says yes even while the surface mind doubts. Either way, {term:healing} is always a collaboration between the one who offers and the one who receives."

From childhood he studied the scriptures, becoming learned enough to discuss with the rabbis while still a boy. As a young man he traveled, seeking wisdom in many places, learning from many teachers. He spent years integrating what he learned, working with his hands as a carpenter, preparing himself for what was to come."

In a flash of rage at a playmate, he touched the other child—and the child was gravely harmed. In that terrible moment, the young Jesus glimpsed the power that dwelt within him: a power that could destroy as easily as create, that could harm as easily as heal."

Every teaching he sought, every practice he undertook, every moment of prayer and meditation was directed toward this purpose: to become a pure vessel for love, never again for destruction."

          "type": "paragraph",
          "text": "This is why his teaching emphasized love so absolutely. It was not abstract philosophy for him. It was the hard-won wisdom of one who knew what happens when power is used without love. His insistence on forgiveness, on non-violence, on blessing those who curse you—all of this came from direct understanding of what power divorced from love can do."

It went against everything the world teaches about success and power. <em>\"If anyone would come after me, let him deny himself and take up his cross daily and follow me. For whoever would save his life will lose it, but whoever loses his life for my sake will find it.\"</em>"

The world says defend yourself, don't let anyone walk over you; Jesus says if someone strikes you on one cheek, turn to him the other also. The world says love those who love you; Jesus says love your enemies, bless those who curse you, do good to those who hate you."

          "text": "First, it means that {term:healing} begins with inner work. You cannot give what you do not have. You cannot channel love if you are blocked by unforgiveness, constricted by fear, dimmed by self-rejection. The path of the healer is the path of self-knowledge, self-acceptance, and self-transformation. Before you can help others recognize their wholeness, you must begin to recognize your own."

          "type": "paragraph",
          "text": "Second, it means releasing attachment to outcomes. The healer who needs to heal, who measures their worth by results, who takes credit for success and blame for failure—this healer will burn out, will suffer, will eventually lose their gift. The true healer offers without attachment. They do their part and release the rest. They understand that {term:healing} happens according to the deep wisdom of each soul's journey, not according to human desire for immediate results."

        {
          "type": "paragraph",
          "text": "Third, it means recognizing that you are not the source. The energy that heals does not originate in you. You are a window, not the sun. You allow light to pass through; you do not generate it. This humility protects both healer and healed. It prevents the inflation of ego that can corrupt the gift. It keeps the healer grounded in the truth of what they actually are: a servant, a channel, a humble instrument of something far greater than themselves."

He pointed to the Source. He invited others not to worship him but to discover the same connection he had found, to become themselves channels of that same love."

This is the promise at the core of his teaching: what he was, we can become. What he did, we can learn to do. Not through our own power, but through the same surrender to love that made him who he was."

Love God completely—which means align yourself with the Source of all, open yourself to that infinite love, let it fill you until there is no room for anything else.
