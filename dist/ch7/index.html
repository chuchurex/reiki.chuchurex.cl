                    <h2 class="sec-title">Jesus in the Inner Planes</h2>
                    <p>The story does not end at the cross. It does not even end at the resurrection. For those who have followed the path of Jesus as healer, as teacher, as the one who demonstrated what pure love looks like in human form, a natural question arises: where is he now? What is he doing? And perhaps most importantly for those called to healing work: is he still available to help?</p>
                    <p>The answers to these questions open a dimension of understanding that transforms how we approach our own work as healers and servants.</p>
                    <p>Jesus did not simply disappear after his time on Earth. The being who walked among us, who healed the sick and opened blind eyes, who spoke of the kingdom within—this being continues to exist and to serve. He has moved on to higher levels of learning, studying now the lessons of wisdom that follow the mastery of love. Yet even as he continues his own evolution, he remains available to those who call upon that frequency of consciousness he embodied.</p>
                    <p>To understand this, we must recognize that physical reality is not all there is. Beyond the world we see and touch exist other dimensions—what might be called the <span class="term" data-note="inner-planes">Inner Planes</span>. These are realms of consciousness rather than matter, inhabited by beings who no longer require physical bodies. Some of these beings are simply between incarnations, resting and preparing for their next life. Others have evolved beyond the need for physical experience altogether. And some—the most relevant to our discussion—have chosen to remain close to the Earth sphere specifically to help those still learning here.</p>
                    <p>Among these helpers are teachers of extraordinary wisdom and compassion. They have graduated, so to speak, from the school of Earth. They could move on to higher realms of learning and experience. But out of love for those who come after them, they have turned back. They have postponed their own advancement to serve as guides, as sources of inspiration, as helpers for those still struggling in physical form.</p>
                    <p>This is a profound sacrifice. To understand its magnitude, imagine completing a difficult degree after years of study, earning the right to move on to more advanced and fulfilling work—and then choosing instead to stay behind and tutor those still struggling with the basics. Not because you must, but purely out of love. This is what these inner-planes teachers have done. They have made themselves available across the ages to anyone who sincerely seeks their help.</p>
                    <p>Jesus occupies a unique position in this arrangement. Having demonstrated the fullness of love in human form, having mastered the lessons of compassion so completely that he could forgive his executioners even as they killed him, he moved naturally into realms of light and wisdom. Yet his connection to Earth and to those who seek to follow his example remains strong. He promised as much: <em>"I am with you always, even to the end of the age."</em></p>
                    <p>What does this presence look like? It is not that the individual being who was Jesus of Nazareth appears physically to help each person who calls on him—though such appearances have been reported throughout history. Rather, there is a consciousness, a frequency, a quality of being that Jesus embodied so purely that it now bears his imprint. This is what might be called <span class="term" data-note="Christ-consciousness">Christ Consciousness</span>—not limited to one man, but a universal principle of pure, unconditional love that Jesus demonstrated and that remains accessible to all.</p>
                    <p>This consciousness has been perceived under many names across cultures and centuries. Some call it the Christ. Others have called it by different names in different traditions. The name matters less than the quality. How do you recognize it? By its fruits. Where there is no pride, no judgment, only love and forgiveness and <span class="term" data-note="healing">Healing</span>—there you encounter this consciousness. Where there is humility, compassion, and acceptance, where you are encouraged to love yourself and others more fully—there this presence is at work.</p>
                    <p>Jesus himself pointed toward this understanding. He said: <em>"The works that I do, you will do also; and greater works than these will you do."</em> He was not claiming exclusive access to the power of love. He was demonstrating what becomes possible when a human being opens fully to that power—and inviting others to do the same. The Christ-consciousness is not something reserved for one special individual two thousand years ago. It is available now, to you, to anyone willing to open to it.</p>
                    <p>For those engaged in <span class="term" data-note="healing">Healing</span> work, this understanding has practical implications. You are not alone in your efforts. When you work with pure intention, with an open heart, with genuine desire to serve—you connect with a vast network of helpers in the inner planes. Some of these helpers are beings who once walked the Earth as healers themselves. Others are teachers who specialize in guiding those who serve. And available to all who resonate with his frequency is the consciousness that Jesus embodied.</p>
                    <p>This is not to say that every impression, every intuition, every seeming guidance comes from high sources. Discernment is essential. The inner planes contain beings of various levels and intentions, just as the physical world does. But the test is simple: does this guidance lead toward love? Does it encourage humility and service? Does it help you become a clearer <span class="term" data-note="channel">Channel</span> for healing, or does it inflate your ego and separate you from others? True guidance from Christ-consciousness always moves toward love, toward unity, toward healing. It never promotes pride or specialness or judgment of others.</p>
                    <p>Many healers report experiences of receiving help during their work—a sudden knowing of what to do, an influx of energy beyond their own, a sense of presence guiding their hands or their words. These experiences are not imagination. They are moments of connection with the helpers who stand ready to assist anyone working in service to others. The more you open to this possibility, the more available this help becomes.</p>
                    <p>The connection is made through resonance. Like tuning a radio to a particular frequency, you tune yourself to the frequency of love and service, and you become capable of receiving what is broadcast on that frequency. Prayer is one way of tuning. Meditation is another. The sincere intention to serve, held consistently over time, gradually refines your ability to receive. You do not need special rituals or secret knowledge. You need only a pure heart and a genuine desire to help.</p>
                    <p>Jesus said: <em>"Where two or three are gathered in my name, there I am among them."</em> This is not poetry or metaphor. When people come together in the spirit of love and service—when a healer and the one seeking healing meet in that sacred space of genuine care—a third presence enters. The consciousness of love itself joins the encounter. This is why healing circles, prayer groups, and even simple one-on-one sessions can carry such power. The human participants create the opening; something greater flows through.</p>
                    <p>He also promised to send a helper: <em>"I will ask the Father, and he will give you another Advocate, to be with you forever—the Spirit of truth."</em> This Spirit—this presence of guidance and comfort and empowerment—was not meant only for the disciples who heard those words. It was promised to all who would follow the path of love. It remains available now. It waits only for your willingness to receive.</p>
                    <p>What does this mean for your work as a healer? It means you can approach each session knowing that help is available. Before you begin, you can take a moment to open yourself, to invite the presence of love to work through you. You can release the burden of thinking you must do this alone, with only your own limited resources. You can trust that when you offer yourself as a channel for healing, the channel will be filled from sources far greater than yourself.</p>
                    <p>It also means you can trust the process even when you cannot see the results. The helpers in the inner planes see what you cannot see. They know what the person before you truly needs, which may or may not be what they think they need. When you surrender to the guidance of love, you allow the healing to take whatever form serves best—even if that form surprises you, even if it looks different from what you expected.</p>
                    <p>The relationship with these inner-planes helpers is not one of dependency. They do not want you to worship them or to rely on them for every decision. Their purpose is to help you become more fully yourself—to help you access your own connection to the infinite source of love and wisdom. The best guidance always leads you back to your own heart, your own knowing, your own direct relationship with the divine. A true teacher makes themselves unnecessary over time.</p>
                    <p>Jesus embodied this principle perfectly. He did not seek followers who would remain forever dependent on his physical presence. He sought to awaken in others the same consciousness he carried. He wanted not worshippers but fellow servants, not dependent children but mature brothers and sisters capable of doing the works he did—and greater works still.</p>
                    <p>This invitation stands open. The one who walked the hills of Galilee healing the sick continues his work from realms beyond our sight. The consciousness of pure love that flowed through him remains accessible to all who open to it. The helpers who have dedicated themselves to assisting humanity stand ready. All that is required is your willingness—your humble, sincere, loving willingness to serve.</p>
                    <p>You are not alone. You have never been alone. And the works of love that you are called to do—the healing, the teaching, the simple acts of kindness and presence—these works are supported by more help than you can imagine. Open your heart. Invite the presence. Trust the process. And watch what becomes possible when human willingness meets divine love.</p>
